# 🔐 Password Hashing Implementation with Bcrypt

## Problem Statement
Previously, user passwords were stored as **plain text** in the database, which is a critical security vulnerability. If the database is compromised, all passwords are exposed.



### Step 1: Installed Bcrypt Package
```bash
npm install bcrypt
```
Bcrypt is an industry-standard library for secure password hashing.

---

### Step 2: Imported Bcrypt in server.js
```javascript
import bcrypt from "bcrypt";

const SALT_ROUNDS = 10; // Cost factor for hashing
```
- **Salt Rounds = 10** means the hashing algorithm runs 2^10 = 1024 iterations
- Higher = more secure but slower

---

### Step 3: Updated Signup API
**Before (Insecure):**
```javascript
// Password stored as plain text
db.query(sql, [name, email, password], ...)
```

**After (Secure):**
```javascript
// Hash password before storing
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS);
db.query(sql, [name, email, hashedPassword], ...)
```

---

### Step 4: Updated Login API
**Before (Insecure):**
```javascript
// Compared plain text in SQL query
const sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email=? AND password=?";
```

**After (Secure):**
```javascript
// Fetch user by email only
const sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email=?";

// Then compare password using bcrypt
const match = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
if (match) {
    // Login successful
}
```

## How Bcrypt Works

```
User Password: "mypassword123"
                    ↓
            bcrypt.hash()
                    ↓
Stored in DB: "$2b$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMye.IjqQBrkHx5..."
              └─────┬─────┘
           60-character hash (irreversible)
```

## Files Changed

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| [package.json](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/rohan/OneDrive/Desktop/Collage_Proj/package.json:0:0-0:0) | Added bcrypt dependency |
| [server.js](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/rohan/OneDrive/Desktop/Collage_Proj/server.js:0:0-0:0) | Updated signup & login with bcrypt |

---

## Testing Steps

1. **Clear old users** (they have plain text passwords):
   ```sql
   TRUNCATE TABLE users;
   ```

2. **Create new account** via signup form

3. **Check database** - password will look like:
   ```
   $2b$10$XKxEZB1G...
   ```

4. **Login** with the new account

---

## Security Benefits

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Password Storage | Plain text `password123` | Hashed `$2b$10$...` |
| If DB Leaked | All passwords exposed | Passwords protected |
| Rainbow Table Attack | Vulnerable | Protected (unique salt) |
| Brute Force | Easy | Very slow (10 rounds) |
